# PLANT-DISEASE-DETECTION-WITH-KERAS


## ABSTRACT

Diseases are natural events that can have significant impacts on plants, reducing productivity, quality, and quantity of products. The leaf is the most important component of the plant to inspect for plant diseases. For the purpose of avoiding agricultural losses, accurate leaf disease detection and classification are essential. Different plant leaves transmit various illnesses.
Visual monitoring is a difficult and time-consuming method for detecting plant diseases.

## Proposed Method

The proposed system aims to develop a software solution to identify and classify plant leaf diseases with high accuracy and clarity. The identification of different types of plant species was examined. Various steps of image processing needed to apply on the video frames before it can identify the diseased plant. In this module the detection model detects the type of plant disease. Before training all the images are preprocessed. Images are extracted from video frames  This image is then passed onto the model then classifies the type of disease Another key contribution of the proposed system includes most of the real-world challenges of the plant illness diseases detection and classification .The dataset collection and experimentation on these datasets are other major benefits of the proposed work.
